# Linear Algebra Codes
This project is a bunch of codes relating to Linear Algebra operations.

The main aim for me here is to improve my coding skills and enhance my understanding of Linear Algebra by putting things down.

## Features
Currently this includes a row reduction algorithm, which also stores the row operation matrices that are used.  
Eventually I'd like to add an eigenvalue/vector finder, diagonalization etc.
